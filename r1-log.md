### Day X:

**Today's Progress**: 

**Thoughts:** 


### Day 0: July 5, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Positioning, z-index, absolute, fixed, and relative. Went through some of the HTML lessons of Angela Yu's course

**Thoughts:** I feel like I didn't really understand the positioning section. I knew what I was coding was correct but I'm not sure if it really sank in. I definetly need to do more research and put more time into wrapping my mind around this one. 


### Day 1: July 6,2020

**Today's Progress**: Colors as well as a lot on positioning. Specifically ::before and ::after

**Thoughts:** Watched a Youtube Vid that went way more indepth on ::before and ::after. Still not feeling the best at it so tomorrow I'll be watching the rest of the video series to hopefully get a grasp on it.


### Day 2: July 7, 2020

**Today's Progress**: CSS Animation, Bezier Curve

**Thoughts:** Spent a majority of the day trying to link Atom with my Github. Finally got it to start working but WHEW. I need to do my own research on CSS animation. I also need to spend more time in Angela Yu's course on Udemy. Besides that progress is good!


### Day 3: July 8, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Tables Accesibility Code 

**Thoughts:** Wrapped up the tables excersise and did a fair amount of the accesibility problems in FCC. Not a tough day at all



### Day 4: July 9, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Forms

**Thoughts:** Didn't put a lot of work in today. Mostly because it's about to be my weekend so I was a bit checked out. Will be focusing and making up lost time tomorrow 



### Day 5: July 11, 2020

**Today's Progress**: HTML Intermediate Section, Intro CSS

**Thoughts:** I gotta work on making sure I don't just do my coding but also log what I do. Besides that tho I feel like I made a lot of solid revisions to the CV project and actually made it a proper one. 


### Day 6: July 12, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Internal and External CSS

**Thoughts:** I haven't done any FreeCodeCamp lessons in a while which sucks. I need to get back into doing both the course and FCC each day to help maximize my learning.

### Day 7: July 13, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Introduction to CSS, Applied Accessibility

**Thoughts:** Finished the Introduction to CSS section in Angela's course. Got back on the freeCodeCamp
 saddle and did some of the accessibility problems as well.

### Day 8: July 14,2020

**Today's Progress**: Applied Accessibility

**Thoughts:** Finished the Applied Accessibility section of freeCodeCamp. Awesome introduction to making websites accessible for everyone. I definitely feel like I'm gonna need to redo those lessons tho and do my own research to fully understand it.


### Day 9: July 15, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Intermediate CSS Lessons, the smallest amount of python imaginable

**Thoughts:** So I dipped my pinky toe into Python, literally only made a print of Hello World but we out here. I think I'm gonna hold off learning that until after I get Javascript under my belt. I also did some more CSS styling in the bootcamp course I'm working on. 

### Day 10: July 16, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Favicon, Box Model, CSS Display

**Thoughts:** This log is a couple days late. Took the weekend off and completely forgot what I did. I gotta work on that and make sure I keep this consistent even on weekends.


### Day 11: July 20th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Positioning 

**Thoughts:** I’m going so slow through these courses. It took me 30 minutes to finish one lesson on CSS Positioning cause I kept getting confused on relative and absolute CSS positioning. Guess I’ll just add that to the list of stuff I need to learn more about


### Day 16: July 27th, 2020

**Thoughts:** Haven’t given a status update in a minute. Still been coding everyday (except this weekend). That being said I’ve finally hit my first “fuck I’m stuck” moment. My webpage has a white space at the bottom. There is nothing but rage and confusion in my heart.

### Day 17: July 29th, 2020

**Thoughts:**  I FINISHED MY PORTFOLIO SITE. I'll be honest it looks better on desktop and I need to get better at responsive design BUT I DON'T CARE RIGHT NOW. LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOO. 

### Day 18: July 30th, 2020

**Thoughts:** Lecture heavy day today on UX and UI. Didn’t really code much so I’m probably gonna go through some freeCodeCamp lessons or work on a challenge from frontendmentor later tonight

### Day 19: Aug 2nd, 2020

**Thoughts:**  We back nerds. Finished the Web Design section of the course I'm working through. Also finished the Flexbox section of freeCodeCamp. I have no idea what I'm doing lol. I'm gonna take some time to research come of these concepts I'm struggling with

 ### Day 20: Aug 4th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Flexbox

**Thoughts:** Flexbox, so much flexbox. I finished the last section on CSS Grid in FCC and decided before I went to the challenges I'd learn more about Flexbox and grid. Focused on Flexbox today and did a lot of flexbox tutorials and games. Have I said Flexbox enough?

### Day 21: Aug 5th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: More Flexbox

**Thoughts:** I'm going too slow on these flexbox tutorials. They're really helpful but I should be wrapping them up by now and I feel like I haven't really made enough progress. It is starting to make more sense though so maybe I'm going at the right pace 

### Day 22: Aug 6th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: GitHub

**Thoughts:** Today I focused on creating two files in Github, first was a file where I can put all of my learning resources that I want to go through. The second was a file for topics I want to learn more about. Will be hitting the grind again tomorrow or later tonight 

### Day 23: Aug 12th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Flex-Grow (Flexbox Zombies)

**Thoughts:** So I completed the activity regarding flex-grow in flexbox zombies. Low key it was kinda difficult and I had to go over it again. Honestly I think I know what I'm doing now but it took me all of my learning session to figure it out. I had to change my mindset from focusing on how big the item got to the ratio of space the item is taking. 

### Day 24: Aug 13th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Flex-Shrink, Flex-Basis, Order, Flex-Wrap

**Thoughts:** I am so sick of doing flexbox zombies, but I'd be lying if I didn't say it's really helped me get a solid understanding of Flexbox. That being said, I'm over it and over learning about flexbox, but before I can move forward I really want this and grid underwraps before I get started with the coding projects for FCC and Frontend Mentor

### Day 25: Aug 16th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Ding ding, you guessed it, Flexbox 

**Thoughts:** Finished Flexbox Zomibes. Incredibly helpful and really did explain Flexbox perfectly. Now I just gotta finish WesBos' tutorial on Flexbox and then I can consider this topic done and I'll move on to CSS Grid

### Day 26: Aug 17th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Gulp JS

**Thoughts:** So I was working through Wes Bos' course on Flexbox and hit a pretty aggressive snag. He's using an old version of Gulp that is no longer available and it really put a halt on what I was doing. I don't think I need it to keep going since all I'm trying to learn is flexbox. That being said, adding Gulp JS to the list of stuff I want to learn more about because it looks extremely useful. 


### Day 27: Aug 18th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Flexbox / Grid

**Thoughts:** Had to stop the code along with Wes Bos due to a lot of the videos being extremely outdated and no longer useable which sucks but it is what it is. 

### Day 28: Aug 19th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Grid

**Thoughts:** Completed CSS Garden and have a solid start on the Grid. Gonna work on a getting through a some reading and see if there are any tutorials on it that I can follow as well. 

### Day 29: Aug 20th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Grid Flexbox Responsive Design

**Thoughts:** Went through CSS Trick's Guides on Flexbox and Grid. The grid one was kinda tough because I didn't have the same amount of playtime with it as I did with Flexbox, which means I def need to find more tutorials and challenges that explain it so I can get a better grasp on it. I started Udacity's course on responsive web design. Once I finish that as well as solidifying my knowledge on Grid, it'll be time to start some projects....... finally 

### Day 30: Aug 22nd, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Responsive Web Design

**Thoughts:** Worked through part 1 of the project in the course and BOY DID I LEARN THE HARD WAY. Spent 3 hours completely doing the project wrong. I overthought the instructions and paid the price for it. 

Reflection: My first mistake was overthinking the instructions. Once I added the Viewpoint meta tag I thought everything was supposed to become responsive when in fact none of the elements were adjusted to be responsive. After that happened I immediately switched my screen to a smaller size and try to fix everything. What I should of done was go through each line of CSS and make sure all of my units were set to be responsive and widths were at 100%, and then from there adjusting the size and seeing what happens at smaller viewpoints.

### Day 31: Aug 23rd, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Responsive Web Design

**Thoughts:** Today was lecture heavy. Lessons today discussed media queries, viewpoints, a bit on grid and flexbox as well. Didn't code at all this morning and I'm itching to learn from my mistakes yesterday. I feel pretty confident I can get started with challenges off Frontend Mentor later this week 

### Day 32: Aug 24th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Responsive Web Design

**Thoughts:** On the final project for the responsive web design course. Gonna try to wrap that up tonight and then I can finally get started with building sites
