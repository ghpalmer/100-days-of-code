### Day X:

**Today's Progress**: 

**Thoughts:** 


### Day 0: July 5, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Positioning, z-index, absolute, fixed, and relative. Went through some of the HTML lessons of Angela Yu's course

**Thoughts:** I feel like I didn't really understand the positioning section. I knew what I was coding was correct but I'm not sure if it really sank in. I definetly need to do more research and put more time into wrapping my mind around this one. 


### Day 1: July 6,2020

**Today's Progress**: Colors as well as a lot on positioning. Specifically ::before and ::after

**Thoughts:** Watched a Youtube Vid that went way more indepth on ::before and ::after. Still not feeling the best at it so tomorrow I'll be watching the rest of the video series to hopefully get a grasp on it.


### Day 2: July 7, 2020

**Today's Progress**: CSS Animation, Bezier Curve

**Thoughts:** Spent a majority of the day trying to link Atom with my Github. Finally got it to start working but WHEW. I need to do my own research on CSS animation. I also need to spend more time in Angela Yu's course on Udemy. Besides that progress is good!
