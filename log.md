# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 6, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Positioning, z-index, absolute, fixed, and relative. Went through some of the HTML lessons of Angela Yu's course

**Thoughts:** I feel like I didn't really understand the positioning section. I knew what I was coding was correct but I'm not sure if it really sank in. I definetly need to do more research and put more time into wrapping my mind around this one. 


### Day 1: July 7,2020

**Today's Progress**: Colors as well as a lot on positioning. Specifically ::before and ::after

**Thoughts:** Watched a Youtube Vid that went way more indepth on ::before and ::after. Still not feeling the best at it so tomorrow I'll be watching the rest of the video series to hopefully get a grasp on it.
