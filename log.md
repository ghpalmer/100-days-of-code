# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 6, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Positioning, z-index, absolute, fixed, and relative. Went through some of the HTML lessons of Angela Yu's course

**Thoughts:** I feel like I didn't really understand the positioning section. I knew what I was coding was correct but I'm not sure if it really sank in. I definetly need to do more research and put more time into wrapping my mind around this one.
