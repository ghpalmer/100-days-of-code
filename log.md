### Day X:

**Today's Progress**: 

**Thoughts:** 


### Day 0: July 5, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Positioning, z-index, absolute, fixed, and relative. Went through some of the HTML lessons of Angela Yu's course

**Thoughts:** I feel like I didn't really understand the positioning section. I knew what I was coding was correct but I'm not sure if it really sank in. I definetly need to do more research and put more time into wrapping my mind around this one. 


### Day 1: July 6,2020

**Today's Progress**: Colors as well as a lot on positioning. Specifically ::before and ::after

**Thoughts:** Watched a Youtube Vid that went way more indepth on ::before and ::after. Still not feeling the best at it so tomorrow I'll be watching the rest of the video series to hopefully get a grasp on it.


### Day 2: July 7, 2020

**Today's Progress**: CSS Animation, Bezier Curve

**Thoughts:** Spent a majority of the day trying to link Atom with my Github. Finally got it to start working but WHEW. I need to do my own research on CSS animation. I also need to spend more time in Angela Yu's course on Udemy. Besides that progress is good!


### Day 3: July 8, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Tables Accesibility Code 

**Thoughts:** Wrapped up the tables excersise and did a fair amount of the accesibility problems in FCC. Not a tough day at all



### Day 4: July 9, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Forms

**Thoughts:** Didn't put a lot of work in today. Mostly because it's about to be my weekend so I was a bit checked out. Will be focusing and making up lost time tomorrow 



### Day 5: July 11, 2020

**Today's Progress**: HTML Intermediate Section, Intro CSS

**Thoughts:** I gotta work on making sure I don't just do my coding but also log what I do. Besides that tho I feel like I made a lot of solid revisions to the CV project and actually made it a proper one. 


### Day 6: July 12, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Internal and External CSS

**Thoughts:** I haven't done any FreeCodeCamp lessons in a while which sucks. I need to get back into doing both the course and FCC each day to help maximize my learning.

### Day 7: July 13, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Introduction to CSS, Applied Accessibility

**Thoughts:** Finished the Introduction to CSS section in Angela's course. Got back on the freeCodeCamp
 saddle and did some of the accessibility problems as well.

### Day 8: July 14,2020

**Today's Progress**: Applied Accessibility

**Thoughts:** Finished the Applied Accessibility section of freeCodeCamp. Awesome introduction to making websites accessible for everyone. I definitely feel like I'm gonna need to redo those lessons tho and do my own research to fully understand it.
